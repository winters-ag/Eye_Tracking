# Eye_Tracking
This project is used to show the ways in which you can track mouse movements around the page. 

# To Run
To run this application you can clone it to your pc. 

After you have done that you can run the index.html file to see one way to handle mouse movement tracking.

# Future plans

## Better Tracking
I would like to reconfigure the eyes to track better between the eyes. As of not they look straight ahead if you put them in the middle of the screen, but I would like to sort out the math to make it so it would go cross eyed in that scenario. This I think would be the most true tracking.
